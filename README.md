# GitHub actions for SWI-Prolog

## Future directions

The action currently only installs the latest available version of
SWI-Prolog, amounting to the latest stable. Supporting which version of
Prolog to install might prove useful for cross-version compatibility
tests. Some package features might work in one version but fail in a
subsequent iteration. Running tests against both the stable and
development versions could be a useful practice, for example.
